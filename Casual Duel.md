"Your kind freaks me out..."
[[Kaori]] commented out of the blue.
She was still slightly asleep, laying on the bed, head buried in the pillow. Her tone made it sound more offensive than it should.

"I'm guessing that's because of the eye?"
[[70 Life/75 Characters/751 Main/Rai|Rai]] replied. Rolling her gaze. Rai knew what Kaori meant with that comment. Knowing her that long, you grow accustomed to her lack of tact.

"No, I don't care about your damn eyes. If anything, having them change colour that way is nice..." She said, lifting her head such that she could face Rai.

Their new home was not that big. It was just enough for the two of them.
Actually it wasn't, it only had a single room, thought out for a single inhabitant, a tiny bathroom and a single [[Charging Bay]] for [[EnvSuits]], Rai never really used it that much so it mainly stored Kaori's.
It was very old fashioned, it even had a functional kitchen.
Nowadays every food item is canned and ready to eat with a high degree of culinary detail and delicacy. No one argued with it and as such, cooking first turned into a hobby and later on into a dying art.
Having a kitchen was Kaori's call. In general, she was always determined to learn every single thing there was. Finding ingredients was tough, yet whenever she could, she cooked. Rai could not be bothered to try, yet loved whenever Kaori cooked.
They lived in a somewhat abandoned building, somewhat secluded.
It used to be a nice building on the old centre of the city.
As the cityscape changed and peoples needs shifted, expansion made newer spots on the city more relevant, fading out the former glory of the downtown.
Naturally, these homes were somewhat cheap and affordable. Both of them really did not have to worry about the price of their home, they knew they would not last long there. They never stayed long in any place out of fear of getting caught.

"I see."
Rai replied delighted almost. Now knowing that Kaori was definitely referring to the eyes. Then, gently scratching near her cheekbone and turning to Kaori with a swift motion,
her eye and the surrounding skin began to shimmer with a pale purple hue.

"So you don't mind if I use it for a bit?"

Rai asked with what could be described as malicious intent, yet it is to note, that Rai's puny build and constitution threatened nobody.

Yet something was off.

Kaori assumed a defensive stance almost instantly. Wide awake, absolutely alert, ready for anything, she clenched the sheets instantly.
She had seen the [[Tears of Horus]] in action many times in the past.
She was always freaked when the glow started.

"You always act tough just to hide the fact you don't really have a full grasp of the situation, right Kao?"

Noted Rai with an ominous voice, half of her face now had a bright purple under glow beneath the skin.

"There is no point of lying to you now, right?" Mumbled Kaori nervously.

"Absolutely useless."

Kaori knew that wasn't a bluff.

"But aren't the [[Tears of Horus|stones]] just for thinking? How come you shine while at it?"

She asked, trying to grasp her [[CLAW|claw]] clumsily while still sheathed and resting in the nightstand.

"Knowing when you are lying is simple, I don't even need to think about it. That and detecting lies is just thinking hard about the times you don't lie."

Kaori pondered over that. Was it really that blatant when she lied?

"You know I won't dare hurt you, yet you reach out for your weapon... Am I scaring you, darling?"

Kaori heard those words, yet Rai's lips were shut the entire time.
Was she thinking out loud?
Was she hallucinating?
We're the [[Tears of Horus|tears]] just that powerful?

"Indeed they are that strong."
Rai's reply echoed on Kaori's mind.

Kaori, tried to stand up, fiercely, trying to get a hold of herself. Rai was basically inside of her mind.

"You are so skittish right now. Your CLAW is still on the table. Am I not a threat anymore?"
Rai said with a giggle.

Rai seemed delighted, almost like a predator, contemplating their prey after the fight, like a hard earned price.
Or rather that was Kaori's interpretation of that sentence and overall Rai's face.
Was Rai that powerful?
Strong enough to even change the perception they have on others that easily?

"No. I'm still the threat"
Interrupted.

"You just found out there's nothing you can do to defend yourself. You just surrendered"
Rai was not wrong.

The Myonin knew how to stay calm and collected in the face of fear. She was ready for anything, so thought.
Her calm and collected persona was crumbling as she took every single breath.
She was now experiencing something entirely different.
For the first time.
Kaori was absolutely terrified.
A feeling with a single name unknown to any one of her kind.
Despair.

Back home, Kaori was always taught to be ready for anything, that fear only freezes oneself and to freeze is to die.
They grew accustomed to never fear what they see.
But this was an entire new enemy.
The body in front of her was not a threat but it held so much power, unseen, inside, hidden.
Sealed?
She was afraid of not knowing the unknown.
And Rai knew this.
Rai knew every single detail in Kaori's mind. Every connection, every piece of knowledge, every thought.
For Rai, it was just like reading a book.
For Kaori though, she was being torn apart.

"I love you too."
Rai smiled and said.
Both of them never really ever said those words to each other ever.
By this point, Kaori simply could not respond to anything. She was in a complete catatonic state, fully disconnected from reality.

Naturally, Kaori did not hear that. Absolutely destroyed.
Helpless.
Rai was happy, she had read the entirety of Kaori's mind.
She knew what she needed to know, there was no more use for her really.
Rai's mission was done.
During this time she gained something the [[institute]] could never give her.
Sadly enough, Rai had to make Kaori suffer a bit to get that information.
"Hmm...  What to do..."




"Remember young minds, thought is nothing but a mere feat of concentration. Today's lesson..."

The professor said firmly as he turned on a projector.
Displayed a timer and the title of the lecture.
Mind Flaying.
"Rai, you are often a troublemaker come forth, allow us to think for a demonstration. You might enjoy this."

His eyes were already glowing when he said that.
Rai rose from the seat and clutched the [[Rai's Keyring|keyring]], sat across the instructor, almost solemnly.
Rai's eyes were already purple.
It had already started. A gut feeling arrose. Almost like being hunted.
Or haunted maybe?
To the average eye, much was not seem to be happening. But the entire lecture hall had turned into a battlefield in a second.
The tension could be knifed and spread over toast.
"Shall we begin?"
Inquired the professor while taking a seat, almost pleased of himself.

"It already started."
Replied Rai without expression.

Everyone else attending seem to fade away, almost withering into a fine glitter, almost setting a stage for the two.
No one was physically gone, but rather, the intense focus being placed on the podium was enough for the crowd to fade from existence itself.


"Let's see, young Rai, you always seem to carry much more power than what's expected, as expected. Everyone underestimates you. You are a perfect mind, almost."

"That's something already everyone knows..."

"You seem you did your homework, young one."

"I never study, I just pay attention."

"Precisely. That is a one degree extraction."

"Huh?"

"By accessing a single point of information and finding out it's relations and functions, you are able to address every other point of information related to the original point. You don't study because everyone around you did it for you. You simply extract that information based on their behaviour. You know this already. You are cheating in the most elegant way."

"You mentioned the concept one degree extraction, used it and eventually taught it to me via the others. This means you expect that I use it to extract more information regarding the remaining degrees of separation."

"Are you not going to do so, young one?"

"No, I won't, you know that much."

"That means you are doing it as we speak."

"As in unconscious thought?"

"Precisely, young one. You never have actually read about Arbitrary Neural Oscillation Exploits, yet you use it on the daily. How did you learn that?"

"I didn't."

"You simply use it. You have learned to do so by mere necessity."

Rai was starting to feel lightheaded from the logic being thrown in. She was now questioning everything. This was bad. Having thoughts right now was basically a death sentence. While basically broadcasting the content of your brain is a quick and easy way to get your mind flayed.

"..."

"Your silence. It is awfully loud, you know? But that is okay. You understood from the start that deviating your thoughts exposes your guard. This is the first demonstration on mind flaying I give and you seem to know what to do and what not to do. You never fail to amaze me, young one. but that raises a question. What bizarre situation were you in to have needed to use this knowledge..."

"..."
Rai remained silent. Trying to remain calm and focused on nothing. Pure white. Emptiness. Nothing.

"You stole them, didn't you?"

The professor said firmly, using his actual voice.

"...!"

Rai knew lying was useless. 

But how?
Rai never told anyone the tears appeared in the first place. No one else lived after [[accident]]. No one was supposed to live.
Memories from that day were starting to leak out. Memories even Rai could not remember.

The room was back to normal, everyone stared at Rai suddenly, murmurs began to grow, their contents unknown to Rai but one thing was certain. The truth was exposed.

"Well, ain't that swell, young one."

Said the professor in a condescending tone, while standing up.

"You shouldn't even be here, the tears are not yours, you don't deserve my time. But that much you know since I taught you to do so."

This was bad. Rai was on the verge of tears, holding back the shame. Rai as always showed no expression at all. Just a blank stare. No one really knows how to interpret that hollow stare on the face of that young scholar.

"I know how to read that hollow face though..."
Kaori's voice suddenly queues in.

"What, how, why, where, what..."
Rai questioned absolutely baffled.
How was Kaori in the room right now?
Why was her voice here?
This moment in time was before Rai met her.
And why out of all things does she say that?

"Because you are broadcasting your memory, young one."
Said the professor.

"Professor, why is my future girlfriend here?" Inquired Rai with a stern tone.

"Because I'm not here, she is."

"Professor, I beg of you, is this your doing?"

"A third degree extraction."

"What?"

"This is my real lesson to you, Rai. I'm able to pinpoint who your partner is, how they sound like and how they would respond to your thoughts."

"But I don't know her."

"Correct, you don't, and you know that, hence, you know that they exist."

"So basically the existence of a fact proves that there is indeed a trigger of the fact itself."

"Big words for something you already know, dummy"
Kaori murmured on Rai's mind.

That feeling.
The feeling of being with someone you love.
Right behind you.
That was real.
But no one was there.
She was on the lecture hall.
How?
Nothing made sense in Rai's eyes.
She knew what day it was, it was a lecture, several years ago.
Was this a memory?
Was this reality?
Is Kaori even real?

"Fourth degree."
The professor declared as Rai's mind was starting to lose its grip on reality.

"Professor, are you lying to me?"

"You should know that by now."

"Are you making me pay for my sins?"

"You should also know that by now, and not from me."

"I'm scared."
