She always hated how the suit fitted her. She felt weirded out by almost everything about it, its slight humming sound, how the ankles were slightly too tight to run comfortably, how the helmet pressed on her cheeks, but what she hated the most was the fact that her suit never picked up environmental hazards on time.

[[EnvSuits]] have evolved over time to become thinner, lighter and more capable. Everyone used them, even when not needed, but now, she knew she couldn't take it off. As per usual for the [[Myonin]], she was ready to fight. Although, she knew, deep inside, that fighting was best executed with a suit.

She didn't know what she was up against, nor did she care, her naturally skittish and agile nature meant she was almost never caught off guard. She was ready for anything, yet she remained calm. This and her faulty suit which she was just way too lazy to get fixed (or rather replaced at that point) made her senses sharper. Not relying on tech made her senses keen at all times.

She knew that her time was up. With absolutely no haste whatsoever, she stood, stretched and opened her [[TacPack]]. After mindlessly fiddling with its contents, she eventually pulled out a relic of the past, or rather, her own rendition of it. A small box, silver in colour and very ornate, the design was done by herself in her spare time with her own [[CLAW]], engraving it with care, these boxes were common eons ago, no one knows really why, but she liked it regardless. After toying with it for a brief time, she opened it, revealing only a single unit left.

"Ahhh, if only I could share one with you..." She said to herself in a calm tone whilst taking the only cigarette left in the box, proceeded to snap it shut and toss it back into the TacPack. She crouched and struck firmly against the wall she was sitting on with her palm. 

"At least the lighter still works."

EnvSuits were easily modifiable, many Myonin figured out the effectiveness, and also the charm of letting things burn, so naturally, they started to include strike flint pads on their suits and to carry anything flammable to produce fire on the go. 

She got lost in her own thoughts while staring at the flame on her fingertip. Indeed, her suit was burning, yet she didn't care at all. She was due a new suit anyway. While watching the flickering light, she thought about how much effort it took to actually make the cigarettes she now lacked.

  
  

"Careful now." [[Rai]]'s voice echoed on her mind, "Every second we spend here is a second wasted. act fast." She nodded to herself, staring at the colossal tower she had ahead of herself. Mostly ruined, these concrete and metal structures stood ominous in the barren plains. Even though they seemed just fine, one could never be sure what to expect inside one of these enigmatic fortresses.

As she fastened the strap on the TacPack, fixing it in place, she took a glance behind her, hoping to find some comfort in Rai's brown eyes. Those eyes were filled with tears. But Rai stood there with fortitude, with profound sadness. This image was forever etched into her memory. 

"I'll come back for you, I swear!" She shouted.

Rai, unfazed, replied firmly. "I love you, but don't promise things you cannot achieve."

She sighed, took a deep breath and approached Rai slowly.

She knew something Rai didn't. The helmet on every EnvSuit made between the 87th and 91st generation could be pried open with a very specific impact on the left temple. Initially though for emergencies or quick helmet swapping, this feature quickly backfired once everyone using it was suffering from neck injuries or abrupt pressure loss due to the harsh helmet ejection system. It was not a well known feature to the average user and certainly not for Rai.

She approached slowly, as her usual self.

"What are you doi..."

Once a couple centimetres away from Rai and before the sentence was finished, she whacked the helmet with impeccable precision, ejecting it and knocking Rai almost unconscious. Whilst falling, she grabbed Rai by the collar of the suit and pulled towards her. Their lips met, but only briefly. She let go of a now disoriented Rai and headed straight to the monolith. Rai, absolutely baffled by what just happened, laid motionless on the ground for a couple seconds. As time, with its relativistic nature, flowed slowly, Rai managed to get some composure to sit upright in what felt like an eternity.

"I said I will come back for you, even if I don't see you anymore." 

She shouted sternly without looking back. 

"I still owe you the rest of that kiss."

  

Rai was not a Myonin, but deep down Rai knew the importance of that kiss. Completely dumbfounded by the realization that the girl just did something so special and restricted to such few individuals, Rai knew she definitely was coming back, but still doubted her.

"Be safe, [[Kaori]]." Rai uttered silently.

And so with unease and a heavy heart (it's left as an exercise for the reader to figure out who was feeling what) they parted ways into each other's unknown.

  
  

Kaori finally lit the makeshift cigarette and extinguished the flame. The charred fingertip, she took it into her mouth and smoked away her sorrow. With a swift motion, she closed the TacPack and answered a call.

EnvSuits since their earliest conception in the [[Promethean Ages]] had communication capabilities said to be closed loop systems where only a narrow band of frequencies were usable and a select few could talk into. Now, they were equipped with tons of quirks and features for easier communication. One small issue arose for Kaori. EnvSuits require environmental cues for said features, a vital module that has failed her since time immemorial. Kaori had no clue when she was receiving any call. Yet she knew when she was being called for. Call it gut feeling or the intense focus only Myonin were capable of, she knew when to answer, always.

  

"Took you long enough." Kaori said while taking one last puff and tossing the cigarette's butt into oblivion, regretting it instantly since making that one filter took her ages.

"Toss me the location. I'll go where you tell me. Or better yet, come get me, would ya? I'm freezing out here." She complained as she started walking atop the wall she was just sitting on.

"One more hour here and I would have fallen from up here." Kaori looked down upon the city that birthed her 21 years ago now. She was currently standing on one of the highest towers in the area. She did not fear heights, No respected Myonin did.

"Patched it right through." The voice at the other end of the line replied.

"Thanks, love, be there shortly." Kaori said while letting herself fall to the seemingly bottomless drop.

Kaori loved to jump from place to place, She became quite adept at that. It's worth mentioning this feat was second nature for her kind, yet she still cherished each second she spent in the air.

At a moment's notice (the moment being the imminent crash against the steel flooring that covered the city) she unsheathed her CLAW, and threw it against the building.

Kaori prided herself with her CLAW proficiency, but truth be told, it was more of a technical advantage, rather than her skill.

Using the now stuck CLAW, she waited until the fine wire tethered to it became tense. Bracing for the inevitability of the laws of motion, she clenched the wire firmly. Bringing her fall to an almost complete stop right before Kaori became a two dimensional object imprinted on the floor.

"What a show off..." The voice said in a weird tone.

Kaori was unsure if she was getting scolded or flirted with by that comment.

The city was dead silent almost at every time. No soul could be seen, yet Kaori, as every Myonin knew that eyes were everywhere. Hidden away in whatever shadow the dim sun managed to produce.

After a couple minutes of walking quickly, as her usual self, and a quick stop by the usual fountain to get some fresh water. Kaori had arrived at the location she was sent.

"An intercom, quite baroque, if I say so myself." Kaori thought to herself while fidgeting curiously with such antiquity.

"Could you not? You'll call the neighbours." The same voice from the call replied with a characteristic compressed audio from the intercom.

"Oh you are here already! You sneaky fiend." Kaori replied as she opened the door.

"Just get here, everyone is waiting."

"Why do you always talk like there is a crowd following you all the time?"

"Oh you know, it's the usual."

"Right..."

"Second door to the left."

  

Kaori entered a pitch black room, this was no issue for her, Myonin eyes grew adapted to the dark over the eons.

"You know I can see you, right?" Kaori said while removing her EnvSuit.

"I know, but you can't see the rest"

"It's because there are none"

"You wouldn't get it..."

Kaori turned her now naked back onto the figure to finish up removing her suit. When she suddenly felt the figure's grasp on her waist. She did not flinch, nor did she stop, she just kept undressing since she knew she was not in danger.

"I'm just glad you are back." Rai said to Kaori as she turned the lights on.

Rai held that hug for quite some time. Rai was not only hugging a girlfriend, Rai was holding onto life itself at that moment.

"Could you at least let me slip into something more comfortable?" The now naked Kaori begged her captor.

Rai just kept hugging now with an even firmer grip of Kaori's fine waist.

Rai was mumbling unintelligibly and Kaori surrendered and to be fair, nothing is more comfortable than being completely naked, she thought.

After realizing her efforts were futile, Kaori managed to turn around and face Rai. The same weeping brown eyes peeked at Kaori, yet the hug was still binding her with that same fortitude as that day.

Kaori sat on the floor, Rai's arms still around the waistline. Rai simply let go and was now lying almost entirely flat on the floor, still crying, still hugging, still missing what had been lost that day.
